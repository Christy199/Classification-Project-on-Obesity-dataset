# Classification-Project-on-Obesity-dataset

Created a machine learning model that uses a variety of models, including KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and more to predict different levels of obesity.

These are the implemented steps:
1. Data Preparation: Importing necessary dataset
2. Data Cleaning: Ensuring data integrity by handling missing values, inconsistencies, and applying Label Encoding.
3. Data Segregation: Separating features (x) from labels (y).
4. Train-Test Division: Splitting the data to facilitate accurate model assessment.
5. Data Standardization: Ensuring equitable treatment through StandardScaler.
6. Model Development: Creating predictive models using KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB), Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Booster, etc.
7. Performance Metrics: Evaluating the model's performance through measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

* Technologies used:
-Python, pandas and NumPy for data handling
-Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization

Outcome:
Effectively engineered a strong machine learning model for predicting the obesity levels, showcasing exceptional accuracy. 
Obtained a 96% accuracy using XGB classifier.
